> Prepared by Sensics, Inc. on 2-Apr-2015

This directory deals with specific interfaces. 

A physical device might implement several interfaces. Just like a multi-function printer might have a printer, fax, phone and copier interface, and HMD might have a display, orientation tracker and audio interface. The way specific devices are mapped into interfaces is discussed in the Device Integration Proposals directory
