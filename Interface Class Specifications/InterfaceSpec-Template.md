# Interface Class Specification: NAME HERE

## Device class summary


### Examples
- Devices and links
	

### Relation to other classes
**Factoring**: How is the data conveyed in this interface different in a meaningful way from other interfaces that merits separating it?

**From other instances of the same interface**: Might there be analysis plugins providing this interface based on input of the same interface type? (Tracker filtering, etc)

**From other classes**: How might this interface's data be computed or exposed from other interfaces? (Joystick turned into tracker, for instance)

**To other classes**: How might this interface's data be re-used or analyzed to produce data on other interfaces? (In the case of analog interfaces, joystick to tracker would be an example)

## Messages
