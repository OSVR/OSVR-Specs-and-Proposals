# OSVR Specs and Proposals
Interface class specifications and device integration proposals in development

- includes specific types of interfaces such as:
	- Analog
	- Button
	- Configuration
	- Eye tracking
	- Gesture
	- Imaging
	- Locomotion
	- Poser
	- Skeleton

- includes discussions on how to factor vendor-specific devices into OSVR interfaces
- includes graphML diagrams of the proposals, generated using the free yED tool http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/

As of January 2017, here is the implementation status of the various interfaces:
